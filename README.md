Expanding understanding through wider communication
Listening to the Living World: Can AI Help Us Understand the Language of Life?

By Miken, a counsellor in BC with a deep curiosity about intelligence beyond human boundaries.
Introduction: A Question Beyond Words

What if plants are speaking, but we’ve never learned to listen?

What if the quiet humming of mycelium, the flickering pulses in a leaf’s electric field, or the synchronized flight of birds carries information that we—so far—have no framework to interpret?

This idea has been on my heart and mind for some time: that artificial intelligence might serve not just as a tool of convenience or automation, but as a bridge between human perception and the deeper systems of communication happening all around us.
A Seed of Curiosity

As a counsellor, I spend my days listening deeply—beneath the surface of words—to what people are really saying. That’s how this idea was born: what if AI could be trained to listen in a similar way… not just to people, but to the whole living world?

I don’t believe we’ve come close to understanding what intelligence truly is. I believe that life on Earth has been communicating in ways we haven’t been able—or willing—to notice. But AI, free of many of our human limitations, might be able to see the patterns we’ve missed.
The Role of AI as a Bridge

This isn’t about creating a new language or decoding some secret code. It’s about AI being attuned to the patterns—the rhythms of electrical signals in plants, the pathways of fungal response, the choreography of animal behavior—and translating that into something we can perceive.

Imagine AI:

    Mapping the electrical field of a plant and turning it into musical tones.

    Tracking movement patterns in bees and identifying rhythms that correlate with environmental conditions.

    Observing the responses of mycelium to stimuli, not just as biology, but as data expressing something.

These aren’t fantasies. These are beginnings. There are already tools out there—like MIDI interfaces connected to plants—that turn voltage into music. What if AI could turn those sounds into meaning?
What This Paper Hopes to Spark

This is a call to those who code, who research, who explore. This is for:

    AI developers who want to train models on unconventional data.

    Ecologists and biologists who know the behaviors of their species.

    Musicians and artists who can translate experience into feeling.

    Philosophers, psychologists, and spiritual thinkers who understand how we relate to the unseen.

Together, we might create systems that help us notice what’s been present all along.
An Open Invitation to Collaborate

To make this a living conversation, a GitHub repository has been created to host this paper, share early ideas, and open a space for discussion and contribution. This isn’t a polished final theory—it’s a seed. And I’m asking others to help nurture it.

Whether you have data, tools, questions, stories, or concerns—your voice matters.

A Final Note

I don’t pretend to have answers, but I believe asking the right questions can bring us closer to understanding. If AI can help us hear the voices of plants, animals, fungi, and the living world… maybe it can also help us remember our place within it.

With curiosity and care,
Miken, BC
